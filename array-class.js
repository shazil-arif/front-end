/**
 * Problem: 
 * Implement a class with static methods that takes an array and callback argument
 * Make the methods fully robust accounting for bad inputs and edge cases
 * Write a few test cases to test each method
 * Implement all the array methods: forEach, reduce, map , filter, flat, join, concat, find
 * What are the performance considerations for these methods? Example forEach vs a traditional for loop (for let i = 0; i < ....)
 * Explain static methods
 * explain the exact differences between for of, for in, forEach and traditional for loop
